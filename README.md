## Dependencies

The code is based on PyTorch and requires a few further dependencies, listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml). It should work with newer versions as well.

### Datasets

Most datasets will be downloaded directly on running the code. However, [Tiny ImageNet](https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/) needs to be downloaded separately for the data loader to work.

### Pretrained models

All the pretrained models for all the datasets can be [downloaded from here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~viveka/focal_calibration/).

## Training a model

In order to train a model, please use the [train.py](train.py) script. The default configuration (i.e., just running ```python train.py```) will train a ResNet50 model on the cross-entropy loss function. The following are the important parameters of the training:
```
--dataset: dataset to train on [cifar10/cifar100/tiny_imagenet]
--dataset-root: path of the Tiny ImageNet dataset (not necessary for CIFAR-10/100)
--loss: loss function of choice (cross_entropy/focal_loss/focal_loss_adaptive/mmce/mmce_weighted/brier_score)
--gamma: gamma for focal loss
--lamda: lambda value for MMCE
--gamma-schedule: whether to use a scheduled gamma during training
--save-path: path for saving models
--model: model to train (resnet50/resnet110/wide_resnet/densenet121)
```

As an example, in order to train a ResNet-50 model on CIFAR-10 using focal loss with ```gamma = 3```, we can write the following script:
```
python train.py --dataset cifar10 --model resnet50 --loss focal_loss --gamma 3.0
``` 

## Evaluating a model

In order to evaluate a trained model, either use the [evaluate_single_model.ipynb](Experiments/evaluate_single_model.ipynb) notebook or you can also use the [evaluate.py](evaluate.py) script. The script provides values of calibration error scores ECE, AdaECE and Classwise-ECE along with model accuracy. In order to use the script the following parameters need to be provided:
```
--dataset: dataset to evaluate on [cifar10/cifar100/tiny_imagenet]
--dataset-root: path of the Tiny ImageNet dataset (not necessary for CIFAR-10/100)
--model: model to train (resnet50/resnet110/wide_resnet/densenet121)
--save-path: path showing the trained model's location
--saved_model_name: name of the saved model file
--cverror: error to cross-validate on for temperature scaling (ece/nll)
```

As an example, to evaluate a ResNet-50 model trained on CIFAR-10, run the script as:
```
python evaluate.py --dataset cifar10 --model resnet50 --save-path /path/to/saved/model/ --saved_model_name resnet50_cross_entropy_350.model --cverror ece
```

The jupyter notebook is simpler to use and quite self explanatory. The following is the result of evaluating the ResNet-50 we trained using the cross-entropy objective.

The test-set classification errors and ECE values obtained from ResNet-50, ResNet-110, Wide-ResNet-26-10 and DenseNet-121 trained on CIFAR-10 are provided in the tables below. For more results, please refer to the paper. The following table shows the CIFAR-10 test set classification error %.

| Model Architecture  | Cross-Entropy | Brier Loss | MMCE | LS-0.05 | FL-3 (Ours) | FLSD-53 (Ours) |

| Wide-ResNet-26-10  | 3.86 | 4.08 | 3.91 | 4.2 | 4.13 | 4.01 |
| DenseNet-121  | 5.0 | 5.11 | 5.41 | 5.09 | 5.33 | 5.46 |

The following table shows the CIFAR-10 test set ECE % for the same models.

| Model Architecture  | Cross-Entropy | Cross-Entropy (T) | Brier Loss | Brier Loss (T) | MMCE | MMCE (T) | LS-0.05 | LS-0.05 (T) | FL-3 (Ours) | FL-3 (T) (Ours) | FLSD-53 (Ours) | FLSD-53 (T) (Ours) |

In the above tables, LS-0.05 denotes cross-entropy loss with label smoothing with a smoothing factor of 0.05, FL-3 denotes focal loss with ```gamma = 3``` and FLSD-53 denotes adaptive focal loss.


## OOD Notebook

To plot the ROC curve and compute the AUROC for a model trained on CIFAR-10 (in-distribution dataset) and tested on SVHN (out-of-distribution dataset), please use the [evaluate_single_model_ood.ipynb](Experiments/evaluate_single_model_ood.ipynb) notebook. The following is the ROC plot obtained from the ResNet-50 model which we trained on CIFAR-10 using the cross-entropy objective function.
